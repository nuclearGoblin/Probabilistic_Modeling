The Homework License

Copyright (c) 2022 Kitty Harris

The Homework license is the MIT license (copied below the dashed line) with the modification that this is my homework, 
and it may be yours, too, so go do your own owrk, ya hippie. In more formal terms -- you may use parts of this code, but
not the code in full, as part of your homework submissions, to the extent it helps you learn the material. This also of 
course does not overwrite the professor's or university's policy on what does or does not count as cheating when it comes 
to coursework.
